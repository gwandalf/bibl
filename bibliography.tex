\section{Goals}

The user will have to achieve a set of tasks. They will be the pretext to test different aspects of the coach presence and interaction.

\paragraph{Directives} In order to tell to the user what is his next task, the coach will have to communicate with him. Three communication modes will be evaluated:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item oral communication;
	\item instructions written or drawn on a virtual support object (e.g, a board or a tablet);
	\item instructions written or drawn in a virtual menu that the user can open as a popup.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Invasive aspects} The social invasive metaphors have to be evaluated. To achieve this goal, a use case will be the coach demonstration step necessary for complex tasks. Four ways will be evaluated:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the coach takes-over the trainee avatar, who can only see what happens but can't interact any more;
	\item the coach uses his own avatar;
	\item the coach uses his own avatar but only the interacting body parts are visible (typically the hands);
	\item The coach uses his own avatar but is not visible at all.
\end{enumerate}
